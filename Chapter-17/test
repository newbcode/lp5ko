Perl is a well-established programming language that 
has been developed through the time and effort of countless\
free software programmers into an
immensely powerful tool that can be used on pratically
every operating system in the world.
Perl started out as the "Swiss army knife" of computer languages and was used primarily by
system administrators, but over time it's grown into an immensely
robust language used by web-developers and programmers worldwide. 
It's also a great way to learn programming techniques and develop your own style of coding.
